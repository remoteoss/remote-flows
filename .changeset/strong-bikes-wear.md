- Export `EstimateError` type from the source [#386](https://github.com/remoteoss/remote-flows/pull/386/)
- buildCostCalculatorEstimationPayload accepts now an array and we're able to export multiple estimations [#391](https://github.com/remoteoss/remote-flows/pull/391)
- Fix `ForceValueField` if statement.description is not available, we'll use the the description [#393](https://github.com/remoteoss/remote-flows/pull/393)
- Expose an `internals` file, this file should be only used in demo apps [#392](https://github.com/remoteoss/remote-flows/pull/392)
